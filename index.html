                    The concept of deep learning (DL) has been known in the neural network community for many years
                    already.
                    With the onset of more powerful computing facilities, especially the prevalence of graphical
                    processing
                    units (GPUs) and tensor processing units (TPUs), DL has been applied successfully and effectively in
                    many state-of-the-art applications
                    including computer vision, speech recognition, object detection, drug discovery, and so on. More
                    recently, the techniques in DL/AI are leveraged for the current COVID-19 pandemic. DL
                    basically uses deep neural network architecture with multiple layers to represent data with
                    increasing abstraction and may be applied to supervised, unsupervised, as well as reinforcement
                    learning.
                    It is one of the fastest growing fields of AI research and current researches include deployment for
                    COVID-19.

                    The Asia Pacific Neural Network Society (APNNS) is a professional society that promotes active
                    interactions among researchers, scientists, and industry professionals who are working in Neural
                    Network and related fields in the Asia Pacific region.
                    APNNS was formalized as a legal entity in 2014, having evolved from the previous Asia Pacific Neural
                    Network Assemby (APNNA) that was established back in 1993 in Nagoya, Japan, under the leadership of
                    Professor Shun-Ichi Amari.
                    More information about APNNS may be obtained at the Society website - <a

                    The APNNS/IEEE Education Forum series on Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence Summer School
                    2020 (DLAI3) is catered to all interested students, engineers,
                    researchers, executives and administrators who may have some basic knowledge of machine learning and
                    AI.

                    back on Feb 1-4, 2018, and <a href="https://deeplearningandaiwinterschool.github.io/past/dlai2.html"
                        target="_blank">the second edition</a> on Dec 10-13, 2018, we are pleased to be able to offer
                    the 3rd
                    DLAI this year. The venue is online due to the current pandemic and it will be held from June 29 to
                    July 3, 2020. We will
                    feature
                    NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI) Workshops as well on the first two days.
                    <br><br>
                    As DLAI3 is a virtual event, it is offered free-of-charge to all academics. Non-academics can attend
                    the NVIDIA DLI Workshops for certification at a deeply-discounted nominal cost that is payable to
                    NVIDIA DLI.
                    All other sessions are also free-of-charge to non-academics.
                    However, there are limited seating available as an online event, priorities will be given to APNNS
                    Members,
                    IEEE-CIS/SMC/RAS Members, INNS Members, and students.
                    <br><br>
                    The DLAI Summer School will cover many aspects of deep learning with several talks by world renowned
                    researchers in form of lectures/tutorials/workshops and panel sessions which will cover the most
                    active current topics in DL and AI and their applications.
                    <br><br>
                    The participants are invited to join in hackathon sessions with specific provided datasets.
