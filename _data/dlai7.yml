about: The concept of deep learning (DL) has been known in the neural network community for well over a decade already. With the onset of more affordable powerful computing facilities, especially the prevalence of graphical processing units (GPUs) and tensor processing units (TPUs), DL has been applied successfully and effectively in many state-of-the-art applications including computer vision, speech recognition, object detection, drug discovery, and so on. More recently, the techniques in DL/AI are leveraged for the language model like ChatGPT, which attract many attentions recently. DL basically uses deep neural network architecture with multiple layers to represent data with increasing abstraction and may be applied to supervised, unsupervised, as well as reinforcement learning. Perhaps DL can be viewed in a literature sense for providing deeper insights into learning systems in general, as it continues to be one of the fastest growing and evolving fields of AI research. The Asia Pacific Neural Network Society (APNNS) is a professional society that promotes active interactions among researchers, scientists, and industry professionals who are working in Neural Networks and related fields in the Asia Pacific region. APNNS was formalized as a legal entity in 2014, having evolved from the previous Asia Pacific Neural Network Assemby (APNNA) that was established back in 1993 in Nagoya, Japan, under the leadership of Professor Shun-Ichi Amari. More information about APNNS may be obtained at the Society website - www.apnns.org.
       <br><br>The APNNS Education Forum series on Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence Summer/Winter School 2023 (DLAI7) is catered to all interested students, engineers, researchers, executives, and administrators who may have some basic knowledge of machine learning and AI. The aim is to provide a forum for interested delegates to learn about the advances in the field of deep learning and artificial intelligence. DLAI7 would also provide an opportunity for interactions and networking. With the successful series of DLAI starting from 2018, we are pleased to be able to offer the 7th DLAI this year. The event is run online to benefit more participants from across different countries and different background.
       <br><br>As DLAI7 is a virtual event, it is offered free-of-charge to all registrants. All participants need to register online first. As there may be limited seating available as an online event, priorities will be given to APNNS Members, IEEE Members, ACM Members, and INNS Members.
       <br><br>The DLAI7 Summer/Winter School will cover different aspects of deep learning with several talks by renowned researchers in the form of lectures/tutorials/workshops and panel sessions which will cover some of the most active current topics in DL and AI and their applications.
